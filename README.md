# notion-stockwidget
Trading View stock widget set up as page for Notion embed - [Create your own here](https://www.tradingview.com/widget/market-overview/)

Paste the "tabs" object into `data.json` and in both script tags in `index.html`. The extra code creates a Light/Dark button for Notion themes. Host your index.html on any public site (I reccomend Netlify) for your own Notion embed!

Live @ https://boring-bartik-a3d13c.netlify.app for demo.

Copy URL and paste into Notion -> Create Embed
